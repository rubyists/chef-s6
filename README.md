Description
===========

A runit_service compatible implementation for s6 supervision trees including logging.

See https://github.com/heavywater/chef-s6/blob/master/recipes/examples.rb for an example

Changes
=======

## v0.0.2
Some modernization of the build, testing the viability of s6 in place of runit.

## v0.0.1

Requirements
============

## Platform:
* Debian/Ubuntu

Recipes
=======

default
-------

Installs and sets up s6 on the system, builds from source, statically compiles slashpackage convention style to the root of the filesystem.

Definitions
===========

The definition in this cookbook will be deprecated by an LWRP in a
future version. See __Roadmap__.

s6\_service
-----------
### Parameters:

* `name` - Name of the service. This will be used in the template file
  names (see __Usage__), as well as the name of the service resource
  created in the definition.
* `directory` - the directory where the service's configuration and
  scripts should be located. Default is `node['s6']['service_dir']`.
* `only_if` - unused, will be removed in a future version (won't be
  present in lwrp). Default is false.
* `finish_script` - if true, a finish script should be created.
  Default is false.
* `active_directory` - used for user-specific services. Default is
  `node['s6']['service_dir']`.
* `owner` - userid of the owner for the service's files, and should be
  used in the run template with chpst to ensure the service runs as
  that user. Default is root.
* `group` - groupid of the group for the service's files, and should
  be used in the run template with chpst to ensure the service runs as
  that group. Default is root.
* `template_name` - specify an alternate name for the templates
  instead of basing them on the name parameter. Default is the name parameter.
* `options` - a Hash of variables to pass into the run and log/run
  templates with the template resource `variables` parameter.
  Available inside the template(s) as `@options`. Default is an empty Hash.

### Examples:

Create templates for `sv-myservice-run.erb` and
`sv-myservice-log-run.erb` that have the commands for starting
myservice and its logger.
